JConHT is a reasoner based on HermiT, and needs to inherit from HermiT's Tableau class. Unfortunately this is defined as a final class which we cannot inherit from without changing the source code of HermiT.

How to change things in HermiT:

  1. download source via Maven
  2. copy project directory somewhere else
  3. change the source code
  4. compile only the changed class, e.g.

      javac -cp org.semanticweb.hermit-1.3.8.500.jar src/org/semanticweb/Hermit/tableau/Tableau.java

  5. update the .jar in the Maven directory, e.g. (executed from the /src-directory where the changed code is)

      jar uf ~/.m2/repository/net/sourceforge/owlapi/org.semanticweb.hermit/1.3.8.500/org.semanticweb.hermit-1.3.8.500.jar org/semanticweb/HermiT/tableau/Tableau.class


Things changed in HermiT so far:

  1. Removed final modifier of class org.semanticweb.HermiT.tableau.Tableau

Things that should be changed (maybe):

  1. Add Visitor for Hermit concepts and roles.
